Gameplay,"Dark Souls is a third-person action role-playing game. A core mechanic of the game is exploration. Players are encouraged by the game to proceed with caution, learn from past mistakes, or find alternative areas to explore. Dark Souls takes place in a large and continuous open world environment, connected through a central hub area (Firelink Shrine). The player character can travel between areas and explore various paths at will, although prerequisites have to be met to unlock certain areas.[1][2][3][4]

A central element to the gameplay of Dark Souls is the bonfire. Bonfires are scattered throughout the world and serve as checkpoints for each level. By resting at a bonfire, the player character is healed to full and regains all of the healing charges of their ""Estus Flask."" They can also level up and perform other functions, such as attuning magic, and repairing and upgrading equipment. However, resting at a bonfire respawns as all of the world's enemies, except for bosses and friendly non-playable characters.

"
Plot,"Dark Souls employs minimalist storytelling to convey its plot and lore. Historical events in its world and their significance are often implicit or left to player interpretation rather than being fully shown or explained. Most of the story is given to the player through dialogue from non-player characters within the game, flavor text from items, and world design.

The opening cutscene establishes the premise of the game. Dragons once ruled the world. In this period, a man known as Gwyn happens upon an object known as the ""First Flame"" and finds the ""Lord Souls."" He and his allies use their power to defeat the dragons, which starts the Age of Fire. Over time, the flames begin to fade with the rise of humans, and Gwyn sacrifices himself to prolong the Age of Fire. With the flame artificially rekindled, the undead curse begins to plague humanity, causing some humans to resurrect upon death constantly.

The player character is a cursed undead, locked away in an undead asylum. After escaping the asylum, the player travels to Lordran to ring the Bells of Awakening. The bells awaken Kingseeker Frampt, who tells the player to ascend to Anor Londo. In Anor Londo, Gwynevere instructs the player to succeed Lord Gwyn and fulfill the prophecy. To accomplish this, the Lord Souls must be acquired from Gwyn's primordial allies and returned to the flame. Optionally, the player may encounter Darkstalker Kaathe who encourages the player not to link the fire but to let it die out and usher in the Age of Dark instead. Once the player acquires the Lord Souls, they travel to the Kiln of the First Flame to battle Gwyn. Once Gwyn has been defeated, the player has the choice of linking the flame to preserve the Age of Fire, or letting it die out to instigate the Age of Dark.

Development and release,"Dark Souls was developed by FromSoftware, with series creator Hidetaka Miyazaki directing and producing. Dark Souls is a spiritual successor to FromSoftware's cult classic previous game, Demon's Souls[7] (which was, in turn, a spiritual successor to From's earlier King's Field series[8]). However, Demon's Souls was published by Sony and Dark Souls by Bandai Namco; this transfer meant that intellectual property rights prevented FromSoftware from making a sequel.[9][10] After two years of development, Dark Souls was released with its numerous similarities (such as the gameplay, online multiplayer, and plot presentation) and differences (such as a connected world and new characters in a distinct universe and storyline) from its predecessor.[11]


The design and development process itself involved a guided freeform approach, with Miyazaki steering designers while allowing them latitude for creativity:

Reception,"Dark Souls received positive reviews from critics upon its release. One of the reviewers for Dark Souls described it as ""a very hardcore dark-fantasy [role-playing game]"" that is ""role-playing right down to the roots,, and stated that the ""massive field map and powerful enemies serve to rev up both your sense of adventure and your sense of dread."" Another reviewer said that ""the sheer happiness you get after the trial-and-error pays off and you overcome the challenge is absolutely impossible to replicate.""[52]

GameSpot scored Dark Souls a 9.5/10. The online system received, as well as the sense of jubilation felt when conquering boss fights after numerous failed attempts. They also suggested that casual gamers may struggle to progress, whereas role-playing game enthusiasts will thrive on the difficulty.[32] IGN gave Dark Souls a 9.0/10, praising the well-thought-out level design, variety, strong emphasis on online features, excessively dark tone and atmosphere, and deep gameplay. While praising the extreme difficulty, they stated that ""there's a difference between punishing, and downright unfair.""[53]

Eurogamer gave Dark Souls 9/10, praising the level design and atmosphere while noting that the game's difficulty might not appeal to casual gamers.[30] Japanese publication Famitsu gave it a score of 37 out of 40.[31]

Jason Killingsworth wrote a response to Thomsen's review for Edge, arguing that the game's ""vertigo-inducing breadth makes it the gaming equivalent of a marathon.""[54] Killingsworth praised the game's length and addictive nature.[54] Edge later retroactively awarded the game 10 out of 10 in their October 2013 20th anniversary issue, stating that over time the breadth and quality of the game's design had overruled complaints about its difficulty.[29]

In a review of the game, Ben ""Yahtzee"" Croshaw praised Dark Souls in his Zero Punctuation video for its deep gameplay and immersive atmosphere, but was ""disappointed"" with the late-game bosses and criticized the difficulty of getting into the game, saying that it would be a critical factor in turning new players off.[55]

Namco Bandai's yearly financial report stated that the game sold 1.19 million units in the United States and Europe by March 2012.[56] FromSoftware announced in April 2013 that the game had sold 2.37 million units worldwide.[57][58]
